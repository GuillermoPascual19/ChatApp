# ChatApp
 Minimal group chat app created by me. A project created for the Distributed Systems course in the Computer Engineering program at the University of Salamanca.

We are trying to replicate a version of the previous project ChatApp. In this version, I'm trying to transform the application into a peer-to-peer (P2P) application.
